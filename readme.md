This is an image captioning project 
Here is the list of files needed for the project.
project_mine.ipynb - File where the Initial data preparation, encoder and training are implemented. 
descriptions.txt - Here image name and each description corresponding to that image is written
model.py - DecoderRNN is defined here, which takes feature vector and encodes captions to produce outputs
data_loader.py - Brings the data to the right format with batches

To make the model work just run each cell in project_mine.ipynb, uncomment cells when needed.
